# A Logic simulator and a simple waveform viewer

This is very beta code but the simulator works.
It uses 7-level logic:
*	Forcing high and low
*	Weak high and low
*	Tri-state
*	Undefined/conflicted
*	Unknown

It really needs a circuit description language;
currently, circuits are built directly in C# in the viewer.
